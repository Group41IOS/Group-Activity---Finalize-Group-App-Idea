## Expense Tracker

### App Description
A better, cleaner, easier way to track your finances that works, and that you actually love using.

### App Idea Evaluation
1. Expense tracker
    - **Description**: 
    Allows user to keep track of their weekly expenses
   - **Category:** 
   Finance
   - **Mobile:** 
   Mobile is essential for the instant logging of new purchases -- developing that habit in users is both useful for retaining users, as well as actually improving the user's ability to track finances. Can also give user reminders of the current state of their budget when the app detects that they're stepping into a store (access to the user's geographic location)
   - **Story:** 
   Users want to save money but they have a hard time keeping track of their expenses. The expense tracker will help them keep track.
   - **Market:**  
   Aimed at college students, but anyone  who is trying to save money or stick to a budget can benefit from this app.
   - **Habit:** 
   The user will use this app daily as they keep track of their expenses.
   - **Scope:** 
        - V1 would allow users to input a budget and keep track of how they're doing in sticking to that budget, as they spend throughout a time period (week, month, quarter, year). Could actually be tested by friends -- college students? -- as a more specific market, initially. 
        - V2 could allow users to maintain multiple budgets (and then have a setting to track how the user is doing overall across certain sub-budgets in aggregate). V2 could also allow groups (multiple users) to access the same budget (useful for student groups -- could then connect it to a desktop version or automatically generate Excel speradsheets documenting the expenditures so far; this could help with generating reports to administrators). 
        - V3 could give users reminders of the current state of their budget when the app detects that they're stepping into a store (this requires access to the user's geographic location). 
        - V4 could incorporate partnerships with banks and Venmo to make student budgeting even more intuitive/automatic. Also, perhaps V4 could also include partnerships with popular shops among the main user demographics to create reward users as they reach their goals.
